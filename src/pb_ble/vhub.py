    Creates a "virtual" Pybricks BLE radio that can be used to exchange
    messages with other Pybricks Hubs via connectionless Bluetooth messaging.

    The `VirtualBLE` object implements an interface very similar to the [common Pybricks BLE interface](https://github.com/pybricks/pybricks-api/blob/v3.5.0/src/pybricks/_common.py#L1331)
    available on Pybricks Hubs. The crucial difference is that some methods
    must be called asynchronously.

    `get_virtual_ble()` should be used as an asynchronous context manager:

    ```python
    async with await get_virtual_ble(
        broadcast_channel=2
    ) as vble:
        # Broadcast a random number on channel 2
        val = random.randint(0, 3)
        await vble.broadcast(val)
        # Stop after 10 seconds
        await asyncio.sleep(10)
    ```

    :param adapter_name: The Bluetooth adapter to use, defaults to None
        (auto-discover default device).
    :param device_name: The name of the hub. This may be used as local name
        in the BLE advertisement data, defaults to `VirtualBLE.DEFAULT_DEVICE_NAME`.
    :param broadcast_channel: A value from 0 to 255 indicating which channel
        `VirtualBLE.broadcast()` will use, defaults to 0.
    :param observe_channels: A list of channels to listen to when
        `VirtualBLE.observe()` is called, defaults to None (no channels).
    :param scanning_mode: The scanning mode to use for observing brodcasts,
        defaults to `passive`.
        - Passive scanning is the default and recommended mode.
        However it is not supported by all devices.
        - Active scanning is provided as a well-supported fallback.
        It may negatively impact the power consumption of nearby BLE devices.
    :param device_filter: Provides a mechanism to filter observed broadcasts
        based on the custom name of the sending Pybricks Hub, defaults to None (no filter).
        For example, set this to `Pybricks` to receive only broadcasts from Hubs
        that have a name starting with "Pybricks".
    :return: A `VirtualBLE` object which is loosely adhering to the Pybricks Hub
        BLE interface.
